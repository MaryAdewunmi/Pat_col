The IOM endorsed six patientcenteredness dimensions that stipulated that care must be: respectful to patients’ values, preferences, and expressed needs; coordinated and integrated; provide information, communication, and education; ensure physical comfort; provide emotional  support;  and  involve  family  and  friends.  Patientreported  measures  examine  the patient’s perspective and are essential to the accurate assessment of patientcentered care. This article’s objectives are to: 1) use the six IOMendorsed patientcenteredness dimensions as a framework to outline why patientreported measures are crucial to the reliable measurement of patientcentered care; and 2) to identify existing patientreported measures that assess each patientcentered care dimension.Methods:  For  each  IOMendorsed  patientcenteredness  dimension,  the  published  literature was searched to highlight the essential role of patients in assessing patientcentered care and informing quality improvement efforts. Existing literature was also searched to identify examples of patientreported measures that assess each patientcenteredness dimension.Conclusion: Patientreported measures are arguably the best way to measure patientcenteredness. For instance, patients are best positioned to determine whether care aligns with patient values, preferences, and needs and the Measure of Patient Preferences is an example of a patientreported measure that does so. Furthermore, only the patient knows whether they received the level of information desired, and if information was understood and can be recalled. Patientreported measures that examine information provision include the Lung Information Needs Questionnaire and  the  EORTC  QLQINFO25.  In  relation  to  physical  comfort,  only  patients  can  report  the severity of physical symptoms and whether medications provide adequate relief. Patientreported measures that investigate physical comfort include the Pain Care Quality Survey and the Brief Pain Inventory. Using patientreported measures to regularly measure patientcentered care is critical to identifying areas of health care where improvements are needed.Keywords:  patientcentered  care,  quality  of  care,  quality  assessment,  patientreported measuresMeasuring the quality of patientcentered careThe  Institute  of  Medicine  (IOM)  recommended  that  to  achieve  high  quality  health care,  improvements  were  needed  to  the  delivery  of  patientcentered  care.1  Patientcentered care is responsive to patients’ values and needs and patient preferences guide decisionmaking.1 The IOM endorsed six dimensions of patientcentered care which stated that care must be: 1) respectful to patients’ values, preferences, and expressed needs;  2)  coordinated  and  integrated;  3)  provide  information,  communication,  and education; 4) ensure physical comfort; 5) provide emotional support – relieving fear correspondence: Flora tzelepisPriority research centre for Health Behaviour, University of Newcastle, University Drive, callaghan, NsW 2308, Australiatel +61 2 4924 6275Fax +61 2 4924 6490email flora.tzelepis@newcastle.edu.auJournal name: Patient Preference and AdherenceArticle Designation: PerspectivesYear: 2015Volume: 9Running head verso: Tzelepis et alRunning head recto: Measuring the quality of patientcentered careDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/PPA.S81975Patient Preference and Adherence 2015:9submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comDovepress Dovepress832tzelepis et aland  anxiety;  and  6)  involve  family  and  friends.1  The  six dimensions of patientcentered care endorsed by the IOM1were established by the Picker Institute.2 During the development of the six patientcenteredness dimensions, Gerteis et al drew on empirical research, theory, and patient and provider surveys to maximize validity.2 The Picker Institute3 and the International Association of Patients’ Organizations (IAPO)4have  proposed  alternative  frameworks  of  patientcentered care. However, the principles in the Picker Institute’s3 and IAPO’s4 models of patientcentered care are similar to and largely overlap with the IOMendorsed patientcenteredness dimensions.Patientreported measures developed to assess the quality of patientcentered care include measures of satisfaction with care and measures of experiences of care.5,6 Patientreported measures  are  essential  to  quality  improvement  efforts  as they  provide  the  patient’s  perspective  in  relation  to  areas of  health  care  that  are  of  high  quality  and  aspects  of  care where improvements are needed.7 Patientreported measures are  arguably  the  best  way  to  assess  constructs  that  relate to  patientcenteredness  given  that  patientcentered  care  is responsive to the patient and is guided by patient preferences.1Patientreported measures are also able to collect information that can only be obtained from patients themselves such as whether the patient received adequate pain relief.8Given the IOM used the six patientcenteredness dimensions developed by Gerteis et al2 to recommend improvements to the delivery of patientcentered care,1 the IOMendorsed patientcenteredness framework is used in this article. The objectives  were:  1)  to  use  the  six  IOMendorsed  dimensions of patientcentered care as a framework1 to highlight the crucial role of patientreported measures in the accurate assessment of the quality of patientcentered care; and 2) to identify examples of existing patientreported measures that measure each IOMendorsed patientcenteredness dimension. To  examine  these  objectives,  the  published  literature  was searched to obtain evidence in relation to the role of patients in the assessment of patientcentered care and the importance of patients’ perspectives for informing quality improvement efforts. The published literature was also searched to identify examples  of  patientreported  measures  that  assessed  each IOMendorsed dimension of patientcentered care.This  article  makes  an  important  contribution  to  the literature  by  collectively  examining  all  six  IOMendorsed patientcenteredness  dimensions  and  discussing  reasons why it is important to measure each dimension of patientcentered  care.  Examples  of  measures  that  assess  the patientcenteredness dimensions are provided to encourage rigorous assessment of patientcentered care. Using a suite of measures to comprehensively and accurately assess from the patient’s perspective all dimensions of patientcentered care could assist with prioritizing areas of patientcenteredness where improvements are most needed and facilitate quality improvement efforts.Respectful to patients’ values, preferences, and expressed needsThe IOM recommended that health care should be respectful of patients’ cultural and other values, preferences, and needs.1Patients  should  feel  able  to  express  views,  be  involved  in decisionmaking according to their preferences, and receive respectful care.1 Patientcentered communication delivered by  health  care  providers  has  been  associated  with  better patient emotional health,9 and answering patient questions associated  with  better  longterm  patient  psychosocial adjustment.10 Furthermore, patients with a good health care provider relationship indicated greater satisfaction with care and adherence to prescribed treatment.11A mismatch between physicians’ understanding of patients’ preferences  for  treatment  and  decisionmaking  has  been found.11 However, patients themselves are most knowledgeable about whether care aligns with their values, preferences, and needs. The mismatch between physicians’ perspectives and patients’ views regarding the delivery of care highlights the need to regularly measure patients’ preferences and experiences to ensure that care is responsive to patient values and needs.  Examples  of  patientreported  measures  that  assess patient values, preferences, and needs include the Measure of Patient Preferences, that examines the manner physicians deliver care about cancer diagnosis and management12 and the modified version of the Perceived Involvement in Care Scale.13Coordinated and integrated careThe  IOM  stated  that  health  care  should  be  coordinated and  integrated  and  include  timely  transfer  of  uptodate patient  information  to  health  care  professionals,  and  efficient  transition  of  patients  between  health  care  settings.1A  systematic  review  reported  that  effective  interventions that  improved  the  coordination  of  cancer  care  were  those that  provided  followup,  case  management,  and  onestop clinics.14 Research with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients indicated that problems with coordination of care were associated with poorer ratings of overall cancer care.15Furthermore,  a  specialized  respiratory  coordinated  care community  program  for  people  with  advanced  chronic Patient Preference and Adherence 2015:9submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comDovepress Dovepress833Measuring the quality of patientcentered careobstructive pulmonary disease, demonstrated improvements to length of stay, readmission rates, and hospital admissions per patient per year.16As health care increasingly occurs across various settings and involves several health care professionals, it may be difficult for these providers to determine whether overall patient care  was  coordinated  and  integrated.  Therefore,  patientreported  measures  could  be  used  to  capture  patients’  perspectives of the delivery of coordinated and integrated care and this information could supplement health care records in order to assess the quality of this aspect of care. Patientreported  measures  that  assess  the  delivery  of  coordinated and  integrated  care  include  the  Cancer  Care  Coordination Questionnaire for Patients,17 the Client Perceptions of Coordination Questionnaire,18 and the Care Coordination Measure for the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS®) Medicare Survey.19Information, communication, and educationThe IOM recommended that patients receive clear, accurate, and  understandable  information  about  all  aspects  of  care according to the patient’s preference, including in relation to diagnosis, prognosis, treatments, followup, and support services.1  A  systematic  review  of  cancer  patient  informational needs indicated that 10%–24% of patients had unmet information  needs  at  diagnosis  and  11%–97%  had  unmet information needs during treatment.20 A survey of advanced cancer patients reported that they were least satisfied with information  regarding  prognosis  and  pain  management.21Diabetes  patients  have  also  reported  dissatisfaction  with information received at diagnosis (20%), and wanted further information about the disease and medications (24%).22Only the patient knows whether they received the level of information desired, communication was appropriate, and if information was understood and recalled, highlighting the importance of using patientreported measures to accurately assess the quality of information delivery in regards to patient care. Examples of patientreported measures that assess information provision in relation to health care include the Lung Information  Needs  Questionnaire,  developed  with  chronic obstructive  pulmonary  disease  patients,23  and  the  EORTC QLQINFO25 a measure for cancer patients.24Physical comfortThe IOM recommended that health care promptly provide appropriate  pain  relief  to  patients  and  attend  to  physical symptoms  and  needs.1  Cancer  patients,  particularly  those with  advanced  disease,  commonly  experience  fatigue (60%–90%)25,26 and pain (64%).27 Fatigue after stroke ranges between 38% and 77%,28 and nociceptive pain is experienced by 5%–84% of stroke patients.29 Despite the availability of efficacious treatments, almost 50% of cancer patients with pain are undertreated,30 and 40%–73% reported receiving no assistance or treatment for cancerrelated fatigue.26,31 Cancer patients who experience fatigue use health care services more frequently than those who do not experience fatigue.32 Additionally, more than twothirds of stroke patients with longterm pain had no or inadequate prescribed pain treatment.29Patientreported  measures  are  recognized  as  the  gold standard  for  assessing  cancer  pain  and  fatigue.33  Only patients themselves can report the severity of fatigue, pain or  physical  symptoms,  and  whether  medications  provide adequate pain relief. This highlights the importance of using patientreported measures to determine whether health care appropriately  attends  to  patient  comfort.  Patientreported measures that assess physical comfort include the Pain Care Quality Survey,34 the Brief Pain Inventory used for clinical pain assessment across cultures,35 and the PatientReported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Interference measure.36Emotional support – relieving fear and anxietyThe  IOM  stated  that  health  care  should  address  patients’ emotional  and  spiritual  concerns,  including  anxiety  due to  uncertainty,  fear,  financial  impact,  or  effect  on  family.1Anxiety  ranges  from  10%–49%  in  cancer  patients  and depression  from  0%–49%  and  are  highest  during  cancer diagnosis and recurrence.37 A literature review indicated that 9%–26% of stroke survivors experience severe depression, 16%–52% acute depression, and 17% agoraphobia.38 Unmet need  among  cancer  patients  for  psychological  assistance ranges from 12%–85%, with such unmet needs most common  during  treatment.20  Furthermore,  almost  one  quarter (23%) of people with diabetes wanted more reassurance and psychological support.22Clinician  accuracy  of  patient  psychosocial  wellbeing can be poor, as demonstrated by only 17% of cancer patients classified as clinically anxious and 6% as clinically depressed perceived  as  such  by  oncologists.39  Using  patientreported measures to assess the level of emotional support provided can  inform  quality  improvement  efforts  by  determining  if health care services adequately address patients’ emotional needs and reduce psychological distress.
